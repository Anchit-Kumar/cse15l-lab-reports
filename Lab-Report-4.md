The ssh command was 5 up in my history so I pressed the up button five times and pressed enter to login. \
It did not ask for password since we set up ssh-keygen in lab last time. 

  
## Step 5
Keys Pressed:
`git clone <Ctrl + V>, <enter>` \
`cd l<tab>`

I copied the link for the lab7 fork from the github page and then pasted it after typing git clone so that the \
repository can be cloned onto my local desktop. I then changed working directory to lab7 by using the cd command \
and pressing tab after 'l' in order to autocomplete the command and pressed enter. 
  
## Step 6
Keys Pressed:
`<up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up> \
<up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <enter>`
`<up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up>, <up> \
<up>, <up>, <up>, <enter>`

I went up 24 times and 23 times respectively to find the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` \
command and then the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` \
command since I know that I had used these in lab but then because of all the other commands I'd used it had gone all the way up.\
Perhaps a better approach here would be to use `<Ctrl + R>` instead. 
  
## Step 7
Keys Pressed:
`nano L<tab>.j<tab>`
`<Use touchpad to scroll down to second last while loop> <right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right>` \
`<delete> 2 <ctrl+O> <enter> <ctrl+X>`

I used nano to edit the java file and then went down to the line that needed to be edited using the touchpad on my laptop. I then used the arrow \
keys to navigate to the point where I needed to make the change, made the change and then used Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to edit.
  
## Step 8
Keys Pressed:
` <up> <up> <enter> `
` <up> <enter> `

I used the up keys to complile and run the tests again. This time the tests passed since the correct change was made. \
  
## Step 9
Keys Pressed:
`git add . <enter>` \
`git commit -m "correct ListExamples.java" <enter>` \
`git push <Ctrl+V> <enter>` \

I manually typed out the add command which added all the files to the stage and the commit with message commands. I then typed git push and pasted \
the ssh link for the lab7 github fork and pressed enter which pushed all the code onto the repository.
