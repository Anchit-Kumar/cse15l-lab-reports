# Summary
In this lab session we create a CSE 15L account, ssh into our account and try different commands.\
We also create our own github page to display our work and learn markdown in order to display text on a webpage!

# Setting Up an Account 
We first look at our course account for CSE 15L at the link: \
[Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)\
and then follow the on-screen instructions to reset the password for the account.
  
# Visual Studio Code
We then need to download and set up Visual Studio Code which since I already had I didn't need to.\
You can download it at the site [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \
This is what VSCode should look like once you have it downloaded and set up: \

# Remotely Connecting
We can then remotely connect to the remote server. Since I used a mac, I opened the integrated terminal on \
VSCode and used the command:
`ssh cs15lwi23abc@ieng6.ucsd.edu` \
where abc is replaced by our course specific account. \
This is what I saw upon logging in: \

We can then run commands on the remote server. Here are some of the commands I tried: \
