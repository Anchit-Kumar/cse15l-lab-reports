## grep command
  
The grep command is a command-line utility that searches for specified patterns in text files or streams and prints any matching lines. \
It can be used to search for specific strings or regular expressions in files, and it can also be combined with other utilities to perform \
more complex operations.

### grep -r 
  
The grep -r command is a variation of the grep command that searches recursively through all files in a directory and its subdirectories for \
lines that match a specified pattern. The -r option stands for "recursive" and is used to specify that the search should be performed \
recursively. This is useful when you want to search for a pattern across multiple files in a directory tree without having to specify each \
file individually.

Examples: \
```
$ grep -r "Lucayans"
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

$ grep -r "three million live in San Juan"
travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Puerto Rico is an island of contrasts, perhaps the only destination in the Caribbean where the city streets hold as much allure as the beaches. One third of the island’s population of just over three million live in San Juan, which is undoubtedly the draw for many. One of the leading commercial and industrial centers of the Caribbean, it is characterized by high-rise office blocks and sprawling suburbs. It’s the delights and historical treasures of the old town, however, that capture the eyes and imaginations of most visitors. And beyond the limits of the capital are mountains, rivers and lakes, forests, and plantations waiting to be explored.

non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch3.txt:Most broadly, I believe a general biology awaits founding. And I believe that autonomous agents will prove central to that eVort. The next feature of autonomous agents that I will note in closing this chapter will be central to any general biology. Precisely because an autonomous agent links exergonic and endergonic reactions in work cycles, the breakdown of high-energy sources here can be used to build up structure and organization there. Indeed, the coevolution of autonomous agents naturally leads to a linked web of exergonic and endergonic reactions within and between the autonomous agents. Breakdown of this stuV here is linked to the excess build up of that stuV there. By these linkages, sunlight spattered carelessly on this swirl of stuV ninety-three million miles from our average star cumulates into the wondrous structure of the giant redwoods, tall on the western slopes of the United States and Canada. Precisely because autonomous agents carry out work cycles, they = we = literally build a biosphere.

travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-History.txt:Cancún is now Mexico’s most popular holiday destination, pulling in almost three million tourists each year. New roads have appeared, and televisions and refrigerators are now the norm in villages that didn’t even have electricity 20 years ago. Despite creating a pocket of wealth for the region, Mexico itself suffered a number of crises in the 1980s and 1990s, including a drastic devaluation of the peso in 1995 following months of economic chaos. The US extended 40 billion dollars in loans to stabilize the monetary system. However, confidence in the politicians is still low, and the 22% increase in the price of tortillas, the basic food of the people, in early 2000 indicates that the problems are not yet over.

### grep -c
  
The grep -c command is a variation of the grep command that counts the number of lines in a file or set of files that match a specified \
pattern. The -c option stands for "count" and is used to specify that the command should only display the count of matching lines rather \
than the actual lines themselves. This is useful when you want to know how many lines in a file or set of files match a certain pattern \
without needing to see the actual lines.

### grep -l
The grep -l command is a variation of the grep command that displays only the names of files that contain a match for a specified pattern. \
The -l option stands for "list" and is used to specify that the command should only display the names of files that contain a match, rather \
than the actual lines that match the pattern.

Kauffman/ch4.txt:7:his book, with its curious title, Investigations, seeks new questions about the universe. It is not always that everything is hidden and science must ferret out the mysteries by scouring for unknown facts, although often science proceeds in the manner of finding new facts. Rather it can be the case that the world is bluntly in front of us, but we lack the questions of the world that would allow us to see. There are stories, perhaps merely stories, of the response to early Spanish ships in the Caribbean by native inhabitants. The ships were not seen  there was no concept for them.

Berk/CH4.txt:27:The years of early childhood are often called the high season of imaginative play, and aptly so, since make-believe blossoms during this time, evolving from simple, imitative acts into highly elaborate, imaginative plots involving complex coordination of roles. Eminent child development theorists of the past attached great importance to the role of make-believe play in early development. All were convinced that anything so compelling and engrossing in the life of the young child must be profoundly signiﬁcant.
Berk/CH4.txt:111:In sum, the development of play proceeds from make-believe, with an overt imaginary situation and covert rules, to organized games, with overt rules and a covert imaginary situation. The vast yet nearly effortless learning that takes place through pretending makes it, for Vygotsky, “the highest level of preschool development. The child moves forward essentially through play activity.”18 Make-believe play, in Vygotsky’s theory, is the preeminent educational activity of early childhood.
Berk/CH4.txt:121:Attention is fundamental to all human thinking. It determines the information considered in any task and whether the task will be completed. As any parent or teacher knows, young children spend only short times involved in most activities and are easily distracted. Yet attention becomes more sustained over early childhood—a development that equips children for concentrated involvement, which will be essential for success once they enter school.
Berk/CH4.txt:122:Under what conditions are preschoolers most likely to display sustained attention? Think back to the examples of Sophie’s and Mattie’s behavior at the beginning of this chapter, and the answer will be clear: during play, especially complex play. In two studies, psychologist Holly Ruff and her collaborators sat toddlers and preschoolers at a table of toys. Children’s patterns of attention changed dramatically with age.20 After playing for a short time with a toy, 1- to 2-year-olds dropped it and turned to another. Their attention was externally controlled by the physical properties of the objects. Hence, they ﬂitted from one toy to another and lost interest as the play session progressed. But once children began to set goals in play, the nature of their attention changed. It became effortful, as indicated by eyes ﬁxed on the toys and a determined facial expression. 
Berk/CH4.txt:148:As the ﬁndings just mentioned illustrate, make-believe greatly enriches children’s facility with language. During sociodramatic activities, preschoolers hear speech that describes and comments on actions going on at the moment. This helps ensure that language is understandable because it is in tune with ongoing events. Consequently, when new words arise in the course of a fantasy scene, children can determine their meaning easily from cues in the situation. In this way, vocabulary extends during make-believe as children introduce words they have heard during recent experiences. For example, “I’m going out. I need my cloak,” said 5-year-old Lizzy, mimicking an expression she had heard in a TV movie while grabbing a dress-up raincoat from a hook in the housekeeping area at child care. 
Berk/CH4.txt:201:In addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills, make-believe can be examined on its own terms: as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the child’s inner cognitive and emotional life. In Vygotsky’s theory, the drive to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood. Instead, he maintained, the imagination of later years is an internalized, condensed form of early childhood make-believe that can be considered play without action. We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent self-talk that meanders along, remarking on new experiences, reﬂecting on the past, and predicting the future.50
Berk/CH4.txt:213:Piaget’s view of make-believe play, dominant until recently, asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when children become capable of symbolic thought. He assumed that very young children could not share play symbols with others. Yet in instance after instance, we have seen that adults are central in preschoolers’ play lives, often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative strivings. If adults are prominent in early make-believe, how did researchers manage to adhere to an image of young children as solitary fantasizers for so long? The reason is that until recently, make-believe was largely studied in the laboratory, in sessions in which children arrived one-at-a-time and had no alternative but to play by themselves. 
Berk/CH4.txt:304:An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and self-regulation. Aggressive toys are the most worrisome. Preschoolers who transform a stick or block into a weapon are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture. But equipping children with realistic-looking guns, swords, shields, and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training ground in aggression. Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers.90 Boys’ penchant for high activity, excitement, and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys. Furthermore, when boys play with action ﬁgures modeled on violent TV and movie characters, such as Power Rangers, Transformers, and X-Men, their play narrows to mimicking the characters’ televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped. Video games with violent plots in which children advance by shooting and evading the enemy are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to boys. A growing number of studies conﬁrm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing children to violence.91 Furthermore, video games, even more than TV, are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes.92 
Berk/ch1.txt:34:In a recent provocative study, sociologist Arlie Hochschild spent months getting to know employees at a large Midwestern corporation she called Americo. Whether clerical workers or executives, the majority conﬁrmed the parental state of mind just described: They complained of overly long workdays and frenetic home lives. A surprising ﬁnding, however, was that few Americo workers had taken steps to make work and family more compatible. For example, even well-paid employees were not taking the annual six weeks of federally guaranteed, unpaid family leave time, although they could aord to do so. Nor were they asking for job share or ﬂextime, prominent company policies aimed at increasing the compatibility of work and home. Hochschild concludes, “Many working families are both prisoners and architects of the time bind in which they ﬁnd themselves.”10 
Berk/ch1.txt:37:Although the precise extent of family–work conﬂict in American culture is not clear, its presence and detrimental impact on parent-child interaction and children’s development are well founded. Consider a series of studies that examined length of maternity leave in relation to employed mothers’ psychological well-being and parenting behaviors. Short leaves of 6 weeks or less (the norm in the United States) were linked to maternal anxiety and depression and negative interactions with babies. But longer leaves, of 12 weeks or more, predicted favorable maternal mental health and sensitive, responsive parenting. 14 
Berk/ch1.txt:42:In sum, increasingly pressured adult lives have contributed to parental diculties in granting children the attention they need. When employed parents spend generous amounts of time engaged with their child, they safeguard the child’s development. Under these conditions, children often reap extra beneﬁts from more equitable involvement of both parents. In contrast, a pressured work life that pulls parents away from child rearing undermines infants’ and children’s well-being—cognitively, emotionally, and socially.
Berk/ch1.txt:50:one-sided views.  Well-known theories of child development—Freud’s, Skinner’s, Gesell’s, and Piaget’s, for example—provide little comfort, since dramatic shifts in favored theories have occurred since the launching of systematic study of children about 100 years ago. Indeed, this waxing and waning of theories has contributed greatly to discrepancies in expert child-rearing advice, which (like the theories) has ﬂuctuated between extremes—swinging, like a rhythmic pendulum, from an adult-imposed, directive approach to a child-centered, laissez-faire approach, and back again. As one recent analyst commented, theories and the popular literature for parents “have done their share to undermine the wavering self-conﬁdence of American parents.”27 The roots of these polarized perspectives can be found in centuries-old, dramatically opposing philosophies about the nature of children and child development.
Berk/ch1.txt:53:Parents anxious for their children to display mature behavior were convinced that these experiences would prime them for academic success. But research eventually documented otherwise—that regimented tutoring not adjusted to the child’s interests and capabilities undermines rather than enhances learning, motivation, and self-control. In preschools and kindergartens where much time is spent sitting, listening to teachers, and doing worksheets, children exhibit high levels of stress behaviors, such as wiggling, withdrawal, and talking out. They also show a decline in self-conﬁdence and motivation, expressing doubts about their own ability and retreating from challenging problems. Furthermore, when followed up during the ﬁrst few years of school, children who spent their kindergarten year in a highly teacher-directed classroom achieve more poorly than do agemates who come from kindergartens emphasizing play and hands-on, small-group projects.28
Berk/ch1.txt:59:In contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring, Piaget believed that since development follows a natural, internally controlled stage sequence, what comes from within the child is paramount in guiding cognitive change. The environment, including the social environment, is available for children to interact with as they make sense of their experiences, but it does not determine the evolution of the child’s mind. Instead, Piaget argued that children are in charge of changes in their own thinking and that biological readiness enables them to capitalize on a wider array of environmental opportunities, both physical and social, in revising inadequate, incorrect mental structures and creating new ones.
Berk/ch1.txt:70:Parents who throw up their hands in desperation and search through their own parents’ or grandparents’ shelves for a more “tried and true” vision will ﬁnd themselves mired in the same conundrum. They might, for example, run across Arnold Gesell’s books of the 1940s and 1950s—The Infant and Child in the Culture of Today, The First Five Years of Life, and The Child from Five to Ten38—still prominent in many bookstores. Oering a lock-step description of physical, intellectual, and emotional milestones at each age, Gesell aimed to reassure uneasy parents that children’s problematic behaviors were merely a phase—part of a biologically based sequence requiring understanding, not correction. A search of the previous generation’s parenting handbooks might uncover other volumes of this child-centered wave, including In Defense of Children, Children Have Their Reasons, and even Stop Annoying Your Children and Parents, Behave! 
Berk/ch1.txt:76:The past three decades have seen a continuation of this dichotomy of extremes in parenting advice and educational practice. In the 1970s, titles appeared that blew the whistle on permissiveness and child-centeredness, such as Don’t Be Afraid of Your Child and Power to the Parents. As part of this rebound, Thomas Gordon’s Parent Effectiveness Training 41 oered to rescue parents who had allowed their child to ride roughshod over them. In the realm of children’s learning, books in the behaviorist tradition, advocating intensive, early academic training, resurfaced. A prominent example, Siegfried and Therese Engelmann’s blueprint for raising a brighter preschooler, Give Your Child a Superior Mind, appealed to parents bent on boosting their child’s IQ or—even better—producing a genius. In spelling out the theory, the Engelmanns dismissed the legitimacy of biological readiness and proclaimed,
Berk/ch1.txt:106:If free time is so abundant, why do so many parents say their lives are pressure cookers? The reason, Robinson and Godbey suggest, is that our pace of life is faster. People expect to do more, to live more intensely. Hence, they try to speed up the yield of time, often by doing several things at once—in the case of Angela and Tom, attending to work tasks while ﬁxing dinner, watching TV, and ﬁelding Victor and Jeannine’s urgent pleas for attention. The very activity of squeezing more into the moment exacerbates the belief that time is scarce. This “time-famine” sensation is the wellspring of parental eorts to create quality time in the absence of quantity—a contradiction in terms. 
Berk/ch1.txt:156:Indeed, many eminent child development researchers have countered Harris’s thesis. 74 Genes and peers do not supplant adult agents, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, family friends, and teachers. Harris draws on evidence suggesting that children’s inherited intellectual and personality attributes lead them to evoke particular responses from adults, which further strengthen the child’s inherited traits. For example, a friendly baby receives more social stimulation than a quiet, passive infant; a cooperative, attentive preschooler receives more patient and sensitive interaction than does an inattentive, distractible child; and a bright, advanced child is praised and stimulated more than a child developing more slowly. Hence, Harris concludes, most children follow a genetically preordained developmental course, regardless of parental inﬂuence.
Berk/ch2.txt:36:Vygotsky deﬁned the zone of proximal development as the distance between the child’s actual development (the tasks the child can do individually) and the child’s potential development, “determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”14 The “zone,” as I’ll call it from now on, is the dynamic region in which new capacities form as children tackle culturally meaningful tasks with a mentor’s assistance. Had Jessica been thinking about Tyrone’s “zone,” she might have framed the items on her list this way: 
Berk/ch2.txt:179:Mastery of false belief shows that children regard beliefs as interpretations, not just reﬂections, of reality. It marks the transition toward a more complex, active view of the mind, which will ﬂourish over the next few years—the realization that people can engage in a great many inner activities, from concentrating, remembering, and understanding to guessing, comparing, and inferring.83 Before age 4, most children assume that physical experience determines mental experience—that if Band-Aids are in the unmarked box, everyone will just know where they are. But preschoolers who grasp false belief recognize that people can, on the basis of prior knowledge and experience, interpret the same event dierently—an understanding that is invaluable for social life. Children who are good at detecting others’ points of view are better at thinking of eective ways to handle dicult social situations.84 Rather than just asserting their own desires, they try friendly persuasion. Or they suggest that a conﬂict be solved by creating new, mutual goals.
Berk/ch7.txt:15:Parents who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their child’s development. It does not take long for most children to see through these false compliments and to question their self-worth. For others, this unconditional parental acceptance may contribute to an unrealistic, overly inﬂated sense of self-esteem, which is also linked to adjustment problems. In one study, second and third graders identiﬁed by their teachers as frequently teasing, starting ﬁghts with, and excluding other children were far more likely than their classmates to rate themselves as perfect on a self-esteem questionnaire.4 Their distorted view of their own competence appeared to undermine any motivation to improve their social behavior.
Berk/ch7.txt:16:Just as parents can’t solve a child’s motivational and self-esteem difficulties through indiscriminate praise, they also can’t do so through critical, impatient remarks or harsh, forceful tactics, as in “You’re lazy!” “Why don’t you try hard like your sister!” “Do that homework or you’ll be punished!” These strategies spark anger and resentment in children and undermine a positive parent–child relationship, on which motivation and effort thrive. And they destroy self-esteem by conveying a sense of inadequacy to children—that their behavior needs to be controlled by adults because they are unable to manage it themselves. 
Berk/ch7.txt:124:As I noted in Chapter 4, pleasurable, rewarding play depends on attaining intersubjectivity, or shared understanding. Children must resolve differences of opinion and ﬁnd ways to meet both their own needs and those of their playmates. When domineering, uncooperative behavior is extreme, the bossy child is likely to be rejected by agemates. Long-term peer rejection, as I indicated in Chapter 5, not only leads to an unhappy social life but to serious adjustment problems in adolescence and early adulthood.
Berk/ch7.txt:178:Also, subtle feedback from adults undermines girls’ conﬁdence in their ability to do well at math. If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject, the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: “Gee, you did a lot better than I expected!” And when the child fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: “You’re not very good at that, are you?” Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys, especially in math.60 In contrast, parents and teachers often attribute boys’ poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. “If only you’d listen and try,” they say, “you’d do much better.”
